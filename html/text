Burger Perfect originates all the way back to 2006 and stems from the success of Pizza Perfect which was started in 1989 by Michael Solomou.

Michael never contemplated franchising his business initially but due to customer demand, coupled with all the positive feedback from his customers and his desire to expand his brand to even more customers, he decided to franchise the business concept.

And so the Perfect franchise was born. With the rapid growth of the business, it became necessary to open a central kitchen where most of the products used in the outlets are produced to the strictest health and quality standards and then distributed to Franchisees.

This went a long way in ensuring that only the freshest and finest quality ingredients are used in all the menu products.

With the same principle of “more is better”, the 100% beef burgers with the finest and always a little more topping than expected, Burger Perfect took its rightful place in the market.

All these years later the Group’s passion for preparing superior Flame Grilled Burgers, with a little bit more, remains the same.
